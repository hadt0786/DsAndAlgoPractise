BINARY SEARCH
// WORKS FOR SORTED ARRAY

Best Case Time Complexity of Binary Search: O(1)
Average Case Time Complexity of Binary Search: O(logN)
Worst Case Time Complexity of Binary Search: O(logN)
Space Complexity of Binary Search: O(1) for iterative, O(logN) for recursive.


1) Contains (True or False)
2) Index of first occurrence of a key
3) Index of last occurrence of a key
4) Index of least element greater than key
5) Index of greatest element less than key
